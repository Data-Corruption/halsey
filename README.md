# Halsey [![Build / Release](https://github.com/Data-Corruption/halsey/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Data-Corruption/halsey/actions/workflows/build.yml) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)

Go-based Discord bot for link expansion and lightweight archiving. Minimal footprint, careful with rate limits, and designed for small private servers of adult friends. Setup assumes developer experience; this isn’t intended for broad distribution. 

```sh
curl -fsSL https://instalsey.regfile.net | sh
```

Currently this is a little hard-coded to my use case. I plan to make it more configurable in the future. E.g. configurable bot name, ollama model, etc. I also plan to add docs.
